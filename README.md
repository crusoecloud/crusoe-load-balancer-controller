# Crusoe Load Balancer Controller

This repository defines the **official Crusoe Load Balancer Controller** for use with [Crusoe Cloud](https://www.crusoecloud.com), the world's first carbon-reducing, low-cost GPU cloud platform.

The controller supports both Crusoe-managed Kubernetes clusters and self-managed Kubernetes clusters.

## Cluster Support

### Crusoe-Managed Clusters
For Crusoe-managed Kubernetes clusters, the controller automatically detects the cluster and uses the appropriate VPC/subnet information. No additional configuration is required.

### Self-Managed Clusters
For self-managed Kubernetes clusters, you need to add specific annotations to your Service objects. See [Self-Managed Clusters Documentation](docs/self-managed-clusters.md) for detailed instructions.
